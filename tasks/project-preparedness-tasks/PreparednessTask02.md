## Project Preparedness Task 2: Hello, Project Reviewers

Don't worry, you're not alone in this project! Not only do you have your instructors and TAs in office hours to rely
on, but you have your own project buddy, and a current ATA participant to help! You will receive an e-mail from ATA 
with the name and alias of your unit two project buddy and near-peer reviewer.

### Milestone 1
**Reviewer: Project Buddy**

Send an email to your project buddy introducing yourself with the following information:
* Your background at Amazon
* A hobby or fun fact
* Any lessons learned from working with your project buddy in unit one. Were there things that your unit one project
buddy did that you found particularly useful?
* Your preference for working through design reviews and ask for their preference (chime meeting, e-mail, etc.)

Once you and your project buddy have decided how you will communicate about design reviews, document this decision in a
file called `pb-preparedness-task2.txt` in the `src/resources` directory. If you run the `preparedness-task2-pb` 
workflow and it passes, put out a CR for your project buddy. The title of your commit and CR must begin with 
`[PPT02][PB]`. Once they have approved the CR push this code to your pipeline.

### Milestone 2
**Reviewer: Near-peer Reviewer**

Send an email to your near-peer reviewer introducing yourself with the following:
* Your background at Amazon
* A request for a piece of advice about what you are finding most challenging at ATA
* Your preference for working through diagram and design reviews and ask for their preference (chime meeting, e-mail, 
etc.)

Once you and your near-peer reviewer have decided how you will communicate about diagram and design reviews, document 
this decision in a file called `np-preparedness-task2.txt` in the `src/resources` directory. If you run the 
`preparedness-task2-np` workflow and it passes, put out a CR for your near-peer reviewer. The title of your commit and 
CR must begin with `[PPT02][NP]`. Once they have approved the CR push this code to your pipeline.
